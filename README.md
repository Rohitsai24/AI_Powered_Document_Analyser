# AI Powered Document Analyser

Welcome to the AI Powered Document Analyser repository! This Streamlit application leverages cutting-edge AI models to extract and analyze text from PDF documents. With this tool, users can upload PDF files, process them to extract text, and query the content using natural language questions. The answers are generated based on the content extracted from the PDFs, utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text detection in images embedded within the PDFs.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Extract text from PDF files, including text embedded in images using OCR.
2. **Text Chunking**: Split the extracted text into manageable chunks for processing.
3. **Vector Store Creation**: Generate vector embeddings for text chunks and store them using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
4. **Conversational AI**: Answer user queries based on the context extracted from the uploaded PDFs using Google's Generative AI models.
5. **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface to upload PDFs and ask questions.
